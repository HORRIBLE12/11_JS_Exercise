## DIY Section

Let's imagine that your mother gave you some money to go out and buy some pork buns.

She gave $5.00 and each pork bun cost $2.00. How many pork buns can you buy with five bucks?
And, how much change do you get back?

You arrive at the pork bun shop and the workers are not run by humans but robots.
The cashier robot only knows how to do very minimal tasks.

The cashier robot has three functionalities: receiving money, calculating how many buns you can buy and 
calculating how much change the customer gets back.

If you look at the code, there's a function called `payPorkBuns`. This function receives the money. In this case, it takes 5 dollars as a value.

Inside `payPorkBuns`, there are two other functions: `calculatePorkBuns` and `calculateChange`

`calculatePorkBuns` calculates how many pork buns can be purchased.

`payPorkBuns` calculates how much change the customer gets back.

`calculatePorkBuns` and `calculateChange` both have two parameters; they take in the value of `money` and `onePorkBun`.

Fill in the rest of code and make sure these two functions return a value.

- `calculatePorkBuns` should return 2
- `calculateChange` should return 1
- use the `return` statement at the end of each function
